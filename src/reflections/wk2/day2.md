#  What are three ways to declare a function and what are the differences?  

#  What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments? 

#  What are high order functions?

>  Function then name.  This way we are defining the function and it can be hoisted.  Let name, function, then paremeters.  This is a function expression and can't be hoisted. let name, arrow, then parameters.  This is a shorter syntax for writing a function expression and doesn't create its own "this" value.


>  Parameters are the names that are passed in a function.  Arguments are the values received from the parameter.


>  When a function accepts a function as a parameter or returns a function, it is known as a high order function.
