# What problem does using exports solve?  

#  How does export differ from export default?  

#  What is the benifit of using the Module system?


>  It makes a module accessible to other parts of our code.


>  Export is used to give access to multiple files and export default is used to give access to a single file.


>  Code can be split into files of self contained functionality.  Modules help organize your code better.  Modules help with naming conflicts.  Code that references the module breaks when the module is changed or moved so it is immediately obvious.  Debugging is easier.
