# What is git and why do we use it?

>Git is a source control solution.
>We use Git because multiple developers can be working on the same project at the same time.  It can insure that there are no conflicts in the code between developers.  Git also makes it easy to revert back to an earlier version of the code.  It is a secure place to save a project besides the local machine.
