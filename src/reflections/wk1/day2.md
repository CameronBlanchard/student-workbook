#  What are Pseudo-Classes and specificity?

>  Pseudo classes are a selector of an element that is a certain state of the element.  Some examples are :hover, :required, :checked.  Specificity is what rules take precedence and the order they are applied.  Over use of !important can create unexpected results that are near impossible to debug.
